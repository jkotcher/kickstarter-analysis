# An Analysis of Kickstarter campaigns
This project set out to examine kickstarter campaigns and looked at several factors that may have an impact on how well kickstarter campaigns performed.
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to help Louise determine the best approach to having a successful kickstarter campaign.  In order to do that we looked at past kickstarter campaigns and looked at several statistics to determine what made a successful campaign and what did not.

## Analysis
The variable that was examined was the category and subcategory of kickstarter campaigns.  Since Louise was looking for funding for a play the category looked at was theater and the subcategory was plays.

## Results
In the US for both the theater category and the plays subcategory there is a large number of successful kickstarter campaigns.  There are 412 successful campaigns for plays in the US.  Within the theater category more broadly there are 839 successful outcomes.  Taking a deeper dive into the data we found that the mean goal amount for successful campaigns was $5,049.  Whereas the mean for failed campaigns was $10,554.  The mean pledged for successful and failed respectively was $5,602 and $559.  The median goal for successful and failed was $3,000 and $5,000, respectively.  In addition, the median pledged amount was $3,168 for successful and $103 for failed campaigns.  According to the box and whisker plot in the UK the number of campaigns to receive funding was very small.  The median value according to this is below $2,000.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
Based on the data present, successful kickstarter campaigns ask for a low amount to begin with and the backers meet that goal.  Whereas it according to the data when campaigns ask for a high amount to begin with then they tend not to do as well.  Based on the results Louise should start out asking for a small amount, somwhere around the median amount for successful campaigns in the US.  Louise also wanted to look at Great Britain for future funding at a later date.  Based on the box and whisker plot she should look to see how the campaign goesin the US and then look to for funding in the UK.  Also I would recommend that she start out with an even lower goal so that the chances she has a successful campaign in the UK are greater.
